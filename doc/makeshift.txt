INTRODUCTION                                                 *makeshift-intro*

You'll want to use this plugin if you work on a lot of projects with different
build systems. You want your editor to be able to detect your current build
system and set |'makeprg'| accordingly.

To make building really fast, bind the |:make| command to a function key in
your |vimrc|. >

    nnoremap    <F5>   :<C-U>make<CR>

HOW IT WORKS                                                   *makeshift-how*
                                                               *makeshift-cmd*

This plug-in works by looking for known build files in the current working
directory upwards, and sets |'makeprg'|; by default this happens on start-up.
You can use the command to re-evaluate |'makeprg'|. >

    :Makeshift

==============================================================================

SETTINGS                                                  *makeshift-settings*
                                                      *'makeshift_on_startup'*
                                                      *'makeshift_on_bufread'*

To prevent Makeshift from setting |'makeprg'| on start-up, put the following
in your |vimrc|. >

    let g:makeshift_on_startup = 0
<

To prevent Makeshift from setting |'makeprg'| on |BufRead|, put the following
in your |vimrc|. >

    let g:makeshift_on_bufread = 0
<

BUILD SYSTEMS                                              *makeshift-systems*

Makshift currently associates the following files with their build systems:

    * Jamfile: bjam
    * Makefile: make
    * Rakefile: rake
    * SConstruct: scons
    * build.xml: ant
    * pom.xml: mvn

==============================================================================

ADDING A NEW BUILD SYSTEM                                   *makeshift-adding*
                                                        *makeshift-overriding*
                                                         *'makeshift_systems'*

If Makeshift doesn't already know about your build system, or you wish to
override the default program for a given file, you can define a dictionary,
which has filenames as keys and corresponding programs as values. >
    let g:makeshift_systems = {
        \'build.ninja ': 'ninja',
        \}
<

==============================================================================

REMOVING A BUILD SYSTEM                                   *makeshift-removing*
                                                         *'makeshift_ignored'*

If you don't want Makeshift to set |'makeprg'| for a given build system, you
can disable it by defining a list of the files to ignore. >
    let g:makeshift_ignored = ['Jamfile']
<

==============================================================================

ISSUES                                                     *makeshift-issues*

Makeshift does not play well with |rails| [vimscript #1567].

As a workaround, put the following in |$MYVIMRC| before Makeshift is loaded: >
    let g:makeshift_define_command = 0
<
